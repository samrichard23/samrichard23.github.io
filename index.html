                        Biomass is biological material derived from living, or recently living organisms. It most often
                        refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called lignocellulosic
                        biomass. As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce
                        heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel. Conversion of biomass to
                        biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: thermal,
                        chemical, and biochemical methods. Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today;
                        examples include forest residues – such as dead trees, branches and tree stumps –, yard
                        clippings, wood chips and even municipal solid waste. In the second sense, biomass includes
                        plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial chemicals,
                        including biofuels. Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants, including
                        miscanthus, switchgrass, hemp, corn, poplar, willow, sorghum, sugarcane, bamboo, and a variety
                        of tree species, ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm (palm oil).

                    <p>
                        Biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy such as methane gas or transportation
                        fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. Rotting garbage, and agricultural and human waste, all
                        release methane gas – also called landfill gas or biogas. Crops, such as corn and sugarcane, can
                        be fermented to produce the transportation fuel, ethanol. Biodiesel, another transportation
                        fuel, can be produced from left-over food products such as vegetable oils and animal fats. Also,
                        biomass to liquids (BTLs) and cellulosic ethanol are still under research. There is a great deal
                        of research involving algal fuel or algae-derived biomass due to the fact that it is a non-food
                        resource and can be produced at rates 5 to 10 times those of other types of land-based
                        agriculture, such as corn and soy. Once harvested, it can be fermented to produce biofuels such
                        as ethanol, butanol, and methane, as well as biodiesel and hydrogen. The biomass used for
                        electricity generation varies by region. Forest by-products, such as wood residues, are common
                        in the United States. Agricultural waste is common in Mauritius (sugar cane residue) and
                        Southeast Asia (rice husks). Animal husbandry residues, such as poultry litter, are common in
                        the United Kingdom.

                        High temperature geothermal energy is from thermal energy generated and stored in the Earth.
                        Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter. Earth's geothermal
                        energy originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of
                        minerals (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The geothermal
                        gradient, which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface,
                        drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the
                        surface. The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots geo, meaning earth, and
                        thermos, meaning heat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The heat that is used for geothermal energy can be from deep within the Earth, all the way down
                        to Earth's core – 4,000 miles (6,400 km) down. At the core, temperatures may reach over 9,000 °F
                        (5,000 °C). Heat conducts from the core to surrounding rock. Extremely high temperature and
                        pressure cause some rock to melt, which is commonly known as magma. Magma convects upward since
                        it is lighter than the solid rock. This magma then heats rock and water in the crust, sometimes
                        up to 700 °F (371 °C).

                        Low temperature geothermal refers to the use of the outer crust of the Earth as a thermal
                        battery to facilitate renewable thermal energy for heating and cooling buildings, and other
                        refrigeration and industrial uses. In this form of geothermal, a geothermal heat pump and
                        ground-coupled heat exchanger are used together to move heat energy into the Earth (for cooling)
                        and out of the Earth (for heating) on a varying seasonal basis. Low temperature geothermal
                        (generally referred to as "GHP") is an increasingly important renewable technology because it
                        both reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling, and it also flattens
                        the electric demand curve eliminating the extreme summer and winter peak electric supply
                        requirements. Thus low temperature geothermal/GHP is becoming an increasing national priority
                        with multiple tax credit support and focus as part of the ongoing movement toward net zero
                        energy.

                        Since water is about 800 times denser than air, even a slow flowing stream of water, or moderate
                        sea swell, can yield considerable amounts of energy. There are many forms of water energy:

                        Historically, hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and
                        reservoirs, which are still popular in developing countries. The largest of them are the
                        Three Gorges Dam (2003) in China and the Itaipu Dam (1984) built by Brazil and Paraguay.
                        Small hydro systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 50 MW of
                        power. They are often used on small rivers or as a low-impact development on larger rivers.
                        China is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than 45,000 small
                        hydro installations.
                        Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity plants derive energy from rivers without the creation of a
                        large reservoir. The water is typically conveyed along the side of the river valley (using
                        channels, pipes and/or tunnels) until it is high above the valley floor, whereupon it can
                        allowed to fall through a penstock to drive a turbine. This style of generation may still
                        produce a large amount of electricity, such as the Chief Joseph Dam on the Columbia river in the
                        United States. Many run-of-the-river hydro power plants are micro hydro or pico hydro
                        plants.

                        Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of
                        global hydropower in 2010. For countries having the largest percentage of electricity from
                        renewables, the top 50 are primarily hydroelectric. China is the largest hydroelectricity
                        producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of
                        domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity stations larger than 10 GW: the
                        Three Gorges Dam in China, Itaipu Dam across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and Guri Dam in
                        Venezuela. Wave power, which captures the energy of ocean surface waves, and tidal power,
                        converting the energy of tides, are two forms of hydropower with future potential; however, they
                        are not yet widely employed commercially. A demonstration project operated by the Ocean
                        Renewable Power Company on the coast of Maine, and connected to the grid, harnesses tidal power
                        from the Bay of Fundy, location of world's highest tidal flow. Ocean thermal energy conversion,
                        which uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters, currently
                        has no economic feasibility.

                        Solar energy, radiant light and heat from the sun, is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving
                        technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics, concentrated solar power (CSP), concentrator
                        photovoltaics (CPV), solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis. Solar technologies are
                        broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture,
                        convert, and distribute solar energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to
                        the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and
                        designing spaces that naturally circulate air. Active solar technologies encompass solar thermal
                        energy, using solar collectors for heating, and solar power, converting sunlight into
                        electricity either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar
                        power (CSP).

                        A photovoltaic system converts light into electrical direct current (DC) by taking
                        advantage of the photoelectric effect. Solar PV has turned into a multi-billion, fast-growing
                        industry, continues to improve its cost-effectiveness, and has the most potential of any
                        renewable technologies together with CSP. Concentrated solar power (CSP) systems use lenses or
                        mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Commercial
                        concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. CSP-Stirling has by far the
                        highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies.

                        In 2011, the International Energy Agency said that "the development of affordable, inexhaustible
                        and clean solar energy technologies will
                        have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries' energy security through reliance on
                        an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability,
                        reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices
                        lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives
                        for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and
                        need to be widely shared". Italy has the largest proportion of solar electricity in the world;
                        in 2015, solar supplied 7.7% of electricity demand in Italy. In 2017, after another year of
                        rapid growth, solar generated approximately 2% of global power, or 460 TWh.

                        Air flow can be used to run wind turbines. Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around
                        600 kW to 9 MW of rated power. The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of
                        the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for
                        the particular turbine. Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and
                        high-altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Typically, full load hours of wind
                        turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually, but might be higher in particularly favorable
                        offshore sites. Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in 2015,
                        with nearly 63 GW of new wind power capacity installed. Wind energy was the leading source of
                        new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and the second largest in China. In Denmark, wind
                        energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met
                        nearly 20%.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total
                        current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical
                        barriers needed were overcome. This would require wind turbines to be installed over large
                        areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore. As offshore wind speeds
                        average ~90% greater than that of land, so offshore resources can contribute substantially more
                        energy than land-stationed turbines.[53]
